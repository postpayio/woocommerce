Buy now and pay later with zero interest and zero fees.

== Description ==

Postpay is a payment solution that allows customers to "buy now, pay later" seamlessly with absolutely zero interest and no fees.

Select Postpay on checkout at one of our partner retailers and we split your total purchase into four equal instalments. The first instalment (25%) is processed immediately and the merchant ships your purchase to you as normal, so you can enjoy now and pay later.

The remaining three instalments are due every two weeks thereafter. Absolutely no interest and zero fees are charged as-long-as all repayments are processed successfully on time. So in short, at the end of the six weeks you only pay for what you ordered!

We benefit most when our customers complete instalments early and so if you want to pay off your instalments early, you can do so at absolutely no extra cost.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of the WooCommerce Postpay plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "Postpay" and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now", then "Activate".

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).
